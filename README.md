# Introduction
Covid-19 Pandemic is one of the worst pandemic outbreaks in the last 100 years. This causes major problems in many sectors in every country and leads to a total lockdown. This has caused people to lose their jobs all over the world. Besides, there are risks for people to get sick from Covid-19 virus. This situation has led to many people having stress and mental health problems. 
Therefore, our team decided to make an application to help people determine their stress severity and give them suggestions to overcome their problems. This app will also be able to connect people to a psychologist so theyâ€™ll be able to share their burden and find a solution.
